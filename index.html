Computer as I love programming and of course Computers. &#128522</p>

<H3 id="Career"><u>My Career Option</u></h3><a href=#About><h5 align=right>Back To About</h5></a>
<p>From my 8<sup>th</sup> standard, I decided that I would like to have my career in the Armed Forces, because of two reasons : 
<ul id="pq">
<li > I love my country so I have an ambition to do something for my country and I feel that the Army is the one to fulfill it.
<li> I have been living in Pune, which is the headquarters of the Army's Southern Command, and likewise I have been able to meet
many Army officers. So these meetings have inoculated in me the love and respect for the Army Uniform.

In my life I had many good experiences as well as those which were unassertive. In my opinion, life is full of challenges
and sometimes we conquer the challenges and sometimes they conquer us.

<H3 id="School"><u>My School Experience</u></h3><a href=#My><h5 align=right>My Experiences</h5></a>
<p>In my schooling, I liked giving quiz competions and even though my ranking would not give me medals but they used to 
satisfy me that "yes my hardwork was good".

I gave the NSTSE (National Science Talent Search Examination) in 2016 and in that my All India Ranking was 2760 and
Maharashtra Rank was 337. I had also given the English Marathon Examination and my Maharashtra Rank was 9. 

Somewhere in 8<sup>th</sup> standard, I developed a passion for the Badminton and till date I have been playing it. I 
am a Intermediate Level Player at the prestigious institute of New Poona District Metropolitan Badminton Association, which
at one time was a home court of great players like Prakash Padukone and Pullela Gopichand. I had also done the SIP Abacus
course which proved very beneficial for me in terms of mathematical calculations.

One of memorable event was that after the 10<sup>th</sup> Board exams were declared, I stood First in the school and I was felicitated
on the eve of Independence Day. </p>

<H3 id="Junior"><u>My Junior College Experience</u></h3><a href=#My><h5 align=right>My Experiences</h5></a>
<p>My Junior College Experience is one of the Golden Experiences of my life. During my life in my Junior College, I participated in my
first coding competition which was too a Web Design Competition !!! In that I didn't won any prize in it but I got a very good experience
from it. I also participated in the General Knowledge Olympiad but didn't get qualified by just one rank. (My rank was 3 &#128561)

In my 11<sup>th</sup> and 12<sup>th</sup>, I was the leader and deputy leader of the project teams and our project was regarding
Environmental Science. During both my project experiences my role was to coordinate between the team members well and to take
care that the information gathering, draft formation and final submission was completed in time. During both the years, it helped me to
realize that how a team functions and what are the roles of a team member.
</p>

<H3 id="nda"><u>My Experience of NDA Entrance Examination and SSB Interview</u></h3><a href=#My><h5 align=right>My Experiences</h5></a>
<p>In my Junior College, I started the preparations for the NDA Examination to fulfill my dream of joining the forces. It was my first experience
of giving a National Level Competitive Examination as it is conducted by the UPSC. But I was fortunate that I was able to qualify the 
Examination in my first attempt and I was called for the Services Selection Board Interview at Bhopal.

Just for a matter of fact, it is interesting to know that the NDA examination is one of the toughest examinations in India and the SSB 
interview is India's toughest interview !!! The SSBs are conducted for 5 days comprising of Stage-I on the first day and the final selection
is done on the last day.

I started preparing for the interview and it was to be in April, 2020 but due to COVID-19 lockdown it was suspended. So, I got a good time to
prepare for it and get to know what happens in this interview. Later, my interview was scheduled in July,2020. The Stage-I of it is normally 
conducted on the first day and I was one of the 18 candidates qualified out of the 70 candidates reported. But unfortunately, I was not able to
clear the last Stage of the interview process. 

I felt low at one time but I knew that I have one more chance to achieve my dream. So, again I started my preparations for my 2<sup>nd</sup>
attempt and meanwhile my score card also came for my first attempt which was 666 out of 1800 and at that time the cut off was 709 for the 
selection. By this I decided that I will improve the next time. Later, I again qualified the examination and was called for the interview again
at Bhopal. I qualified the Stage-I but again I didn't qualify the last round. This time my marks were 775 out of 1800 and the cut off was 696. 
But due to some less marks in my SSB, I did not clear the interview. 

In this chapter of my life, I will never forget the life and the discipline I experienced during my 10 days stay at the Selection Boards. I have 
also got up at 4 am for the interview process !!! It was a good phase as I got to know about how an interview is conducted at a young age. 
Above all, it has increased my desire to join the Indian Army as I also want to <i>"Live a Life Less Ordinary."</i></p>

<H3 id="Engg"><u>My Engineering</u></h3><a href=#My><h5 align=right>My Experiences</h5></a>

<p>When I didn't get selected for NDA, I gave the MHT-CET Examination and I was able to get admission in Computer Engineering branch at
Dr. D Y Patil Institute of Engineering, Management and Research. Till today, my experience with DYPEMR is fantastic. In my First Year,
I gave the NEO Olympiad 4.0 and my national rank was 3055. After giving that Olympiad, I also got an internship opportunity at 
Internship Studio. I chose to do internship in Artificial Intelligence. In that Experience, I got to know how the apps which we use in 
our daily life use AI. The most interesting part of the internship was that I was given an assignment of German to English translation.
Overall, it was a good internship experience.

In my 2<sup>nd</sup> semester, we had Project Based Learning in which we had to create projects on any topic and explain it in our batch.
So, I was included in a six-member team. We all decided to make a project on Cryptography along with a sample program and I was chosen 
as the team leader. So, on my side my duties were to allocate the sub-topics of the project to each and every member as per their capabilities.
I also made sure that the team works in good harmony and make sure that rehearsals and the project and program completion was done
in time. Finally, on the day we presented well and answered all the questions that were asked to us. In that phase, I got to know how
important it is for a team to coordinate and function well in order to achieve a goal. 

I have also done a certification course in Cybersecurity and Its Ten Domains through Coursera, which was offered by The University System of Georgia,
in which I got to know that how important is the data for a company and what are the measures to be taken to secure the private data 
of an industry.

In my second year, I have come into the World of Computers!! In the beginning itself, I got to know many new things in the field of Programming.
Here too, I participated in many competitions like an Essay and Poster Competition on the auspicious occasion of Engineer's Day. I wrote on the topics of 
"Social Media : A boon for Students" and "The real self-fulfillment of Entrepreneurs." I also attended many webinars like "Computer Graphics using Maya",
"Good Programming Standards", and so on.

In the future too, I will be participating in many more such webinars ,competitions and so on. I hope to gain many new experiences and learnings which will be
very beneficial for my future.</p></pre>
